The process begins. At first there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
        The 'manager' does 'process.S00000043##s00000963.InputCriterion.S00000772'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    Once the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00000967.InputCriterion.S00000772'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00000967.OutputCriterion.S00000773'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    Once the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00000968.InputCriterion.S00000772'. The 'manager' does 'decision.S00000964.Fire.S00000784'. After that, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
