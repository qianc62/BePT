The process begins. At first there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
        The 'manager' does 'process.S00000527##s00002218.InputCriterion.S00000937'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    When the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00002225.InputCriterion.S00000937'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00002225.OutputCriterion.S00000939'. All of following paths are processing at the same time:

                The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00002224.OutputCriterion.S00000939'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
            After the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00002220.InputCriterion.S00000937'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00002220.OutputCriterion.S00000939'. Then, the above sequential part is finished. 
    When the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00002226.InputCriterion.S00000937'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00002226.OutputCriterion.S00000939'. Subsequently, the 'manager' does 'process.S00000527##s00002218.OutputCriterion.S00000939'. Then, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
