The process begins when there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
    The manager does process.S00000052##s00001301.InputCriterion.S00000772. Then, the manager does callToTask.S00001304.InputCriterion.S00000772. Subsequently, the manager does callToTask.S00001304.OutputCriterion.S00000773. Subsequently, one of the following branches is executed: 
        The manager does fork.S00001053.Activate.S00000782. Then, the manager does fork.S00001053.Fire.S00000787. After that, the manager does callToTask.S00000967.InputCriterion.S00000772. Then, the manager does callToTask.S00000967.OutputCriterion.S00000773. Subsequently, the manager does callToTask.S00001303.InputCriterion.S00000772. After that, the manager does callToTask.S00001303.OutputCriterion.S00000773. Then, the manager does decision.S00000781.Activate.S00000782. 
        The manager does callToTask.S00001063.InputCriterion.S00000772. Then, the manager does callToTask.S00001063.OutputCriterion.S00000773. Subsequently, the manager does fork.S00001053.Activate.S00000782. 
        When the above path is finished, the manager does fork.S00001053.Fire.S00000784. Subsequently, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
