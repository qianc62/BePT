The process begins. At first there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
        The 'manager' does 'process.S00000689##s00005379.InputCriterion.S00000937'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    When the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00005383.InputCriterion.S00000937'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00005383.OutputCriterion.S00000939'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    When the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00005382.InputCriterion.S00000937'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00005382.OutputCriterion.S00000939'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    After the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'decision.S00000989.Activate.S00000990'. One of following paths needs to be finished: 
        The 'manager' does 'decision.S00000989.Fire.S00000993'. 
        The 'manager' does 'decision.S00000989.Fire.S00000995'. 
        There are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
                The 'manager' does 'decision.S00000989.Fire.S00000991'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
            When the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00005380.InputCriterion.S00000937'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00005380.OutputCriterion.S00000939'. Then, the above sequential part is finished. 
. 
        !fter the above path is finished, then, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
