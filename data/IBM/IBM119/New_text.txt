The process begins. At first there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
        The 'manager' does 'process.S00000409##s00005852.InputCriterion.S00001053'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    After the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00003554.InputCriterion.S00001053'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00003554.OutputCriterion.S00001055'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    When the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00002426.InputCriterion.S00001053'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00002426.OutputCriterion.S00001055'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    When the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00005854.InputCriterion.S00001053'. Then, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
