The process begins. At first there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
        The 'manager' does 'process.S00000539##s00003943.InputCriterion.S00000772'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    After the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00003944.InputCriterion.S00000772'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00003944.OutputCriterion.S00000773'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    When the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00003946.InputCriterion.S00000772'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00003946.OutputCriterion.S00000773'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    After the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00003945.InputCriterion.S00000772'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00003945.OutputCriterion.S00000773'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    Once the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00003947.InputCriterion.S00000772'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00003947.OutputCriterion.S00000773'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
        The 'manager' does 'callToProcess.S00000843.InputCriterion.S00000772'. Then, the 'manager' does 'callToProcess.S00000843.OutputCriterion.S00000773'. 
. 
    !fter the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00002917.InputCriterion.S00000772'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00002917.OutputCriterion.S00000773'. Subsequently, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
