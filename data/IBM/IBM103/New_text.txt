The process begins. At first there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
        The 'manager' does 'process.S00000104##s00002780.InputCriterion.S00000700'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    Once the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToService.S00002787.InputCriterion.S00000700'. The 'manager' does 'callToService.S00002787.OutputCriterion.S00000704'. All of following paths are processing at the same time:
