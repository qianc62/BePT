The process begins. At first there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
        The 'manager' does 'process.S00000147##s00001992.InputCriterion.S00001053'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    When the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToProcess.S00001958.InputCriterion.S00001053'. One of following paths needs to be finished: 
        The 'manager' does 'decision.S00001123.Fire.S00001078'. 
        The 'manager' does 'decision.S00001123.Fire.S00001075'. 
        When the above path is finished, after that, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
