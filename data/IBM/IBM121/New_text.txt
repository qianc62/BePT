The process begins. At first there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
        The 'manager' does 'process.S00000110##s00003058.InputCriterion.S00000700'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    After the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToService.S00003059.InputCriterion.S00000700'. The 'manager' does 'callToService.S00003059.OutputCriterion.S00000704'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
. 
    /nce the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToProcess.S00002085.InputCriterion.S00000700'. The 'manager' does 'callToProcess.S00002085.OutputCriterion.S00000704'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    When the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00002315.InputCriterion.S00000700'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00002315.OutputCriterion.S00000704'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    Once the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'process.S00000110##s00003058.OutputCriterion.S00000704'. Then, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
