The process begins. At first there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
        The 'manager' does 'process.S00000112##s00003240.InputCriterion.S00000700'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    When the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToService.S00003241.InputCriterion.S00000700'. The 'manager' does 'callToService.S00003241.OutputCriterion.S00000704'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
. 
    /nce the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToProcess.S00002464.InputCriterion.S00000700'. The 'manager' does 'callToProcess.S00002464.OutputCriterion.S00000704'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    When the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00001215.InputCriterion.S00000858'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00001215.OutputCriterion.S00000859'. Subsequently, the 'manager' does 'process.S00000112##s00003240.OutputCriterion.S00000704'. After that, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
