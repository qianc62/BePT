The process begins when there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
    One of the following branches is executed: 
        The manager does process.S00000112##s00003240.InputCriterion.S00000700. After that, the manager does callToService.S00003241.InputCriterion.S00000700. 
        The manager does process.S00000112##s00003240.InputCriterion.S00000700. After that, the manager does callToService.S00003241.InputCriterion.S00000700. 
        Once the above path is finished, one of the following branches is executed:

                The manager does callToService.S00003241.OutputCriterion.S00000704. After that, the manager does callToTask.S00002471.InputCriterion.S00000858. 
                The manager does callToService.S00003241.OutputCriterion.S00000704. Subsequently, the manager does callToTask.S00002471.InputCriterion.S00000858. 
                After the above path is finished, one of the following branches is executed: 
                The manager does callToTask.S00002471.OutputCriterion.S00000859. Then, the manager does callToProcess.S00002464.InputCriterion.S00000700. 
                The manager does callToTask.S00002471.OutputCriterion.S00000859. After that, the manager does callToProcess.S00002464.InputCriterion.S00000700. 
                After the above path is finished, then, the above sequential part is finished. 
        The manager does callToService.S00003241.OutputCriterion.S00000704. After that, the manager does callToProcess.S00002464.InputCriterion.S00000700. 
        The manager does callToService.S00003241.OutputCriterion.S00000704. After that, the manager does callToProcess.S00002464.InputCriterion.S00000700. 
        Once the above path is finished, one of the following branches is executed: 
        The manager does callToProcess.S00002464.OutputCriterion.S00000704. Subsequently, the manager does callToTask.S00001215.InputCriterion.S00000858.
