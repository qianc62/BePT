The process begins. At first there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
        The 'manager' does 'process.S00000149##s00001312.InputCriterion.S00000772'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
    When the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00001315.InputCriterion.S00000772'. The 'manager' does 'callToTask.S00001315.OutputCriterion.S00000773'. Subsequently, the 'manager' does 'callToProcess.S00001301.InputCriterion.S00000772'. Subsequently, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
