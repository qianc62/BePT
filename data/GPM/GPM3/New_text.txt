Some nodes ( superT12 superP15 superP13 superT14 ) have to be added to this model to make it a workflow. After workflowfy this process model, the generated text is: 
The process begins. At first there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
    One of following paths needs to be finished: 
        The 'manager' does 'T0'. 
        The 'manager' does 'T1'. Then, the 'manager' does 'T2'. Then, the 'manager' does 'T3'. Then, the 'manager' does 'T4'. 
        Once the above path is finished, after that, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
