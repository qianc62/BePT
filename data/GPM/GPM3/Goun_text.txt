The process begins when there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially:  One of the following branches is executed: 
        The manager does T0. 
        The manager does T1. Then, the manager does T2. After that, the manager does T3. Subsequently, the manager does T4. 
        Once the above path is finished, then, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
