The process begins when there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially:  One option from start to end is the following: 
    There are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
        One of the following branches is executed: 
            There are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
                The manager does T0. Then, one of the following branches is executed: 
                    The manager does T10. After that, the manager does T9. After that, the manager does T14. 
                    The manager does T13. Then, the manager does T12. Then, the manager does T11. 
                    After the above path is finished, the manager does T7. Then, the above sequential part is finished. 
            There are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
                The manager does T0. Then, one of the following branches is executed: 
                    The manager does T1. After that, the manager does T2. Then, the manager does T8. 
                    The manager does T5. Subsequently, the manager does T4. Subsequently, the manager does T3. 
                    When the above path is finished, the manager does T7. Subsequently, the above sequential part is finished. 
            After the above path is finished, then, the above sequential part is finished. 
    The manager does T10. After that, the manager does T15. Then, the manager does T2. 
    After, all of the above paths are finished, then, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
