The process begins when there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
    One of the following branches is executed: 
        The manager does superT29. After that, the manager does T4. After that, the manager does superT31. 
        The manager does superT29. Then, the manager does T0. Subsequently, the manager does superT31. 
        The manager does superT29. After that, the manager does T3. After that, the manager does superT31. 
        The manager does superT29. Then, the manager does T9. After that, the manager does superT31. 
        The manager does superT29. Subsequently, the manager does T7. Then, the manager does T8. After that, the manager does superT31. 
        The manager does superT29. Then, the manager does T6. Then, the manager does superT31. 
        The manager does superT29. After that, the manager does T5. Subsequently, the manager does superT31. 
        The manager does superT29. Then, the manager does T1. After that, the manager does superT31. 
        The manager does superT29. After that, the manager does T2. Then, the manager does superT31. 
        Once the above path is finished, after that, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
