In order to make the process model a workflow, it has to be preprocessed: 
    Add some nodes: SuperP30 P27 P20 P13 P18 P17 superP32 P19 P22 P25 P16 P23 P14 P15 P21 superT29 P28 superT31 P24 P26. 
After workflowfy this process model, the textual description can be generated. 

The process begins. At first there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
        The 'manager' does 'superT29'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
        The 'manager' does 'T4'. 
        The 'manager' does 'T0'. 
        The 'manager' does 'T9'. 
        The 'manager' does 'T5'. 
        The 'manager' does 'T3'. 
        The 'manager' does 'T1'. 
        The 'manager' does 'T6'. 
        The 'manager' does 'T2'. 
        The 'manager' does 'T7'. Then, the 'manager' does 'T8'. 
    Once the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'superT31'. Subsequently, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
