In order to make the process model a workflow, it has to be preprocessed: 
    Add some nodes: SuperP19 superT18. 
After workflowfy this process model, the textual description can be generated. 

The process begins. At first there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
    There is a region which allows for different execution paths listed as following: 
    The 'manager' does 'superT18'. Then, the 'manager' does 'T0'. 
    The 'manager' does 'superT18'. Subsequently, the 'manager' does 'T6'. 
    When, all of the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'T9'. Subsequently, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
