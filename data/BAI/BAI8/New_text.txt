In order to make the process model a workflow, it has to be preprocessed: 
    Add some nodes: 011 superT17 P13 superP16 P14 P12 superT15 superP18. 
After workflowfy this process model, the textual description can be generated. 

The process begins. At first there are some procedures need to be finished sequentially: 
        The 'manager' does 'superT15'. All of following paths are processing at the same time: 
        The 'manager' does 'T4'. 
        The 'manager' does 'T5'. 
        The 'manager' does 'T0'. Subsequently, the 'manager' does 'T1'. After that, the 'manager' does 'T2'. Then, the 'manager' does 'T3'. 
    After the above paths are finished, the 'manager' does 'superT17'. Subsequently, the above sequential part is finished. At last, the process ends.
