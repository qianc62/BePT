Most information systems log events (e.g., transaction logs, audit trails) to audit and monitor the processes they support. At the
same time, many of these processes have been explicitly modeled. For example, SAP R/3 logs events in transaction logs and there are EPCs
(Event-driven Process Chains) describing the so-called reference models. These reference models describe how the system should be used. The coexistence
of event logs and process models raises an interesting question: “Does the event log conform to the process model and vice versa?”. To tackle the problem, we distinguish two dimensions of conformance: fitness
(the event log may be the result of the process modeled) and appropriateness (the model is a likely candidate from a structural and behavioral
point of view).
