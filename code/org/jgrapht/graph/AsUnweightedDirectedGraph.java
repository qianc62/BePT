/**
 * An unweighted view of the backing weighted graph specified in the
 * constructor. This graph allows modules to apply algorithms designed for
 * unweighted graphs to a weighted graph by simply ignoring edge weights. Query
 * operations on this graph "read through" to the backing graph. Vertex
 * addition/removal and edge addition/removal are all supported (and immediately
 * reflected in the backing graph).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that edges returned by this graph's accessors are really just the edges
 * of the underlying directed graph.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This graph does <i>not</i> pass the hashCode and equals operations through to
 * the backing graph, but relies on <tt>Object</tt>'s <tt>equals</tt> and
 * <tt>hashCode</tt> methods. This graph will be serializable if the backing
 * graph is serializable.
