	/**
	 * Convert a JGraphT graph to the representation used in the TouchGraph
	 * library. http://sourceforge.net/projects/touchgraph TouchGraph doesn't
	 * have a sensible, extensible graph object class and so one has to add them
	 * to a TGPanel which will store the graph components (the set of nodes and
	 * edges) in its own way. The closest Touchgraph has to a graph object is a
	 * GraphEltSet but Touchgraph does not provide the visibility to use it
	 * easily and one can use a JGraphT graph. While JGraphT nodes can be any
	 * type of objects, TouchGraph uses a set of com.touchgraph.graphlayout.Node
	 * and com.touchgraph.graphlayout.Edge only. Moreover, TouchGraph edges are
	 * always directed. Having said that, if you want a nice way to visualize
	 * and explore a graph, especially large complex graphs, TouchGraph is very
	 * nice
	 * 
	 * @param graph
	 *            : the JGraphT graph
	 * @param tgPanel
	 *            : the TouchGraph TGPanel
	 * @param selfReferencesAllowed
	 *            : do you want to include self-referenctial edges, ie an edge
	 *            from a node to itself? Self-referential loops do not show up
	 *            in the TG visualization but you may want to subclass TG's Node
	 *            class to show them
	 * 
	 * @return first node of the TouchGraph graph
